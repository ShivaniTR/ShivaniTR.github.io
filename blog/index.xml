      <description>It took me three attempts to successfully install Hugo. I realised the consequence of not reading the doccumentation and instructions properly.
First Attempt I used the apt-get command line tool to install hugo.
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install hugo I went on to explore the themes and and I came across this: *Minimum Hugo Version: 0.82.0
On checking:
hugo version Hugo Static Site Generator v0.40.1 linux/amd64 BuildDate:2018-04-25T17:16:11Z I found that this is the default version the apt-get tool installs</description>
